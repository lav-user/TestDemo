# Postman to SOAtest conversion tool

This import tool requires the Server API license for SOAtest/Virtualize to be active, and the SOAtest/Virtualize server must be running. Please contact your Parasoft Sales Representative if you don't have or require the proper license


======

To import Postman services with this tool, simply run the test file with the datasource pointing to the export to your collection, and update the Environment to point to the SOAtest server you want to upload it to.
